Some Commentary of the Findings of this Visualization Project:

The typical rider is one that has an annual subscription, who is male, and is between the age of 22 and 33.  
Almost two-thirds of the Jersey City riders are subscribers.  While 57% indicated they were male. Approximately
16% of the rider chose not to identify themselves.

Since all of the CitiBike locations are in an upper middle class area, it is expected that most of the riders 
have annual income between $60,000 and $80,000.

The most popular CitiBike start locations are typically located where there are light rail stations.  It can be 
inferred that a majority of riders use the light rail to get to the bike stations and ride locally to wherever they
want or need to go.

Riders between the age of 25 and 35 tend to be the most frequent with the longest duration of rentals.  However, riders 
age 20 and 25 do indicate the longest average duration of rental. During the review of the plot, there is an
odd phenomenon with the data for riders who are 51 that does not look like a typical distribution of data.  This 
may need to be looked at more closely for data integrity.  Other than this anomaly, the data shows are pretty 
interesting distribution around the age of 30.  

As the age increases up to 30, so does the increased number of rides and rental duration.  After 30, it begins to 
ramp down.  This may indicate a change in the riders lifestyle that does not allow for more riding after 30.  This 
could be where riders are getting married or having children or promotions that do not allow for more time for riding.
